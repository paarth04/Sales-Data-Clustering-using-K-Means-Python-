# Sales-Data-Clustering-using-K-Means-Python-
Sales Data Clustering using K-Means (Python)

This project demonstrates how to apply K-Means Clustering on sales data to identify meaningful customer or order patterns using unsupervised machine learning.
We use SALES and QUANTITYORDERED as features, apply feature scaling, determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, and finally assign cluster labels to the dataset.

🚀 Project Objective

Understand patterns in sales data,
Group similar sales records using K-Means clustering,
Visualize cluster quality using the Elbow Method,
Prepare the dataset for further business or analytics insights,
